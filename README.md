# ToggleSprint [AutoSprint] for MC 1.12.2
A mod that holds your Sprint key, revamped from AutoSprint, all credit goes to "RedPer" for the original mod.

Original mod created by RedPer, all credit goes to him, the only thing I did here was porting it to 1.12.2 Forge version of the game + changing some keys and render postions to make it look like the original 1.7 - 1.8 "ToggleSneak".

No other modifications were made.


## HOW TO USE:

When you first launch the mod your default keybind to toggle sprint will be "R", you can change this under the control settings.
